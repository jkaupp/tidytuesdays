# What's #TidyTuesday?

Either you have an interest in cleaning house on Tuesday or you like #rstats, #tidyverse &#R4DS!

TidyTuesday is an initative grown out of Jesse Maegan's (@kierisi) #R4DS  & the community mentor group, started by Thomas Mock (@thomas_mock).  You can read all about it and get involved [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md)
