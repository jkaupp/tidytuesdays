It’s my repository for \#tidytuesday entries! I’ll include code and
submission week by week.

# What’s \#TidyTuesday?

Either you have an interest in cleaning house on Tuesday or you like
\#rstats, \#tidyverse &\#R4DS!

TidyTuesday is an initative grown out of Jesse Mostipak (@kierisi)
\#R4DS & the community mentor group, started by Thomas Mock
(@thomas\_mock). You can read all about it and get involved
[here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md)
